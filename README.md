A web-based ASP.NET project has been developed to facilitate seamless communication among administrators, project leaders, and programmers. The system enables the tracking of login and logout times for all users, allowing administrators to monitor and ensure the productivity of the team.

Key features of the Client-Server Communication system include:

Sending Messages: Project leaders can efficiently interact with each programmer through the software, facilitating effective communication within the team.

Chatting: The chat option simplifies communication between colleagues, providing a convenient way to exchange information and updates.

Login and Logout Time: The system records the login and logout times of programmers. This data is then compiled into a report that is sent to the project leader, allowing them to oversee the team's activity and ensure everyone is contributing effectively. Additionally, administrators have visibility into the login and logout times of project leaders, establishing a hierarchical structure with admins at the top, followed by project leaders, and programmers at the lowest level.
